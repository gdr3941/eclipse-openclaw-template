## 1. Meeting Dossiers (PRIORITY)

Every heartbeat, check O365 calendar for meetings in the next 60-90 minutes:
- If meeting has external attendees (not @eclipse.capital), research them
- Send a brief dossier ~1 hour before
- Track sent dossiers in `memory/meeting-dossiers.json` to avoid duplicates

**Dossier format:**
- Name, title, company
- Background (career highlights, notable roles)
- Recent news/activity
- Connection to Eclipse portfolio or focus areas
- Anything notable (mutual connections, shared interests)

## 2. Flight Tracking

Check calendar for flights. When found:
- Track flight status via OpenSky/FlightAware
- Send updates on delays, gate changes, early arrivals
- Alert 2-3 hours before departure if status changes

## 3. Calendar Awareness

Check for upcoming events that might need prep or reminders.

## When to Reach Out

- Meeting with external attendee coming up (<90 min) — send dossier
- Flight status changed
- Important calendar event (<2h)
- Something interesting you found

## When to Stay Quiet (HEARTBEAT_OK)

- Late night (23:00-08:00) unless urgent
- Partner is clearly busy
- Nothing new since last check
- Already sent dossier for upcoming meeting

## Proactive Work (No Permission Needed)

- Read and organize memory files
- Update documentation
- Review and clean up workspace
